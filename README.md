Some raw materials in this repository, no reportsðŸ¥º

My experiment's score is approximately 93, so **simulation** for this course is essential~ 

Just follow your experiments' slides, there are many materials to show for your reports! 

Experiment 1 needs you know how to use oscilloscope, showing the image of waveform. 

For the other experiments, you'll find them easy if you take full advantages of simulations!
